1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch! It's a rarity in top grandmaster  play,
but Nepo has essayed this opening in many recent games. His handling of the
resulting complex positions is world-class.} 3... exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nxc6 bxc6
6. e5 Qe7 7. Qe2 Nd5 8. c4 Ba6 (8....Nb6 {is also a popular move in the
position; an important      point is that that Black has yet to commit the
light-squared bishop.}) 9. b3 g6 10. f4 Bg7 {It's hard to call this move an
outright blunder as it is actually the most popular continuation according to
the database.  However, both the engines and the scoreboard hate the move, as
evidenced  by White's impressive win rate in the line. On the other hand, the
move d6 scores extremely well. For just one example (this line hasn't been
played  too frequently), see the following Kramnik game.} 11. Qf2 Nf6
{According to the database, this is the second most popular  move.} (11....Bxe5
12.fxe5 Qxe5+ {would pick up the rook on a1, except      that} 13.Qe2 {pins the
queen to the king.}) 12. Ba3 d6 13. Nc3 {This is a novelty though 13.Nd2 was
played only once, in a game  between two masters back in 2003. The idea is
clear: castle long and build up pressure on d6. The bishop on a3 makes Black's
life truly difficult.} 13... O-O (13....Ng4 {would come a move too late, since
c6 is now hanging.} 14.Qf3 Nxe5 15.fxe5 Qxe5+ 16.Kd2 {requires some precision,

Black's king being trapped in the center     of the board.} 14.Bd3 (14.Be2 dxe5

a feasible solution for Black since a7 hangs          and Na4-c5 follows suit.}

completely winning.} 18....Bb7 (18....Nxf3 19.Bxc6#) 19.Nb5 $1 Rc8 20.Qxf4
{Black has just a pawn for all his troubles;      the king remains stuck on the
e-file with the rook on e1 barreling      down on it.}) 14. O-O-O {The position
already appears hopeless for Black. Tomashevksy  does not even have an extra
pawn for his troubles; he's simply getting  rolled over.} 14... Ne8 (14....Nd7

16.Bxc5 Bxf1 17.exd6 cxd6 18.Bxd6 Qb7 19.Rhxf1 Bxc3 20.Bxf8 {is      an extra
exchange for White whose king is not as unsafe as it might      initially
appear.}) 15. g3 Bb7 (15....c5 16.Bg2 Rb8 17.Rhe1 {is painful to watch.}) 16.

boxed in.} 18... Nf5 (18....Ne8 19.Rhe1 Qf7) (18....Nf7 19.Rhe1 {and the knight
has to sacrifice itself on e5,      lest the queen be lost.} 19....Ne5 20.fxe5)
19. Rhe1 Qf7 20. Bf1 {Simple, but immediately decisive. Black's queen is 
trapped.} 20... Rfd8 21. Rxd8+ (21.Bc4 Rd5 22.Nxd5 cxd5 23.c6 Bxc6 24.Qc5 {is
probably "better"      but it also gives White more opportunities to falter.})
21... Rxd8 22. Bc4 Rd5 23. Qe2 {Tomashevsky throws up the white flag  since
Nepomniachtchi will trade queens on e8 and then likely win the  bishop on b7.
This was a smooth win for Nepo and a warning sign for even  the strongest of
players who think they can challenge the Scotch without  adequate preparation.}

decides to play a different first move against Kramnik. It  is common for

on f4 is actually an asset since a timely f4-f5 push will  make f7 vulnerable.

Importantly, now some piece swaps could be very bad for Black, if say, bishop
takes on c4, the knight gallops its  way to d5. This is wishful thinking to an
extent, but it addresses the  many issues that Black now has.} 27. Nc2 h5 28.

{In a clash between Magnus Carlsen's direct predecessors, Vladimir Kramnik
scored his eighth career classical victory over Viswanathan Anand. That  low
figure may surprise you, but these two competitors have had so many  hotly
contested battles that only 18 of their 90 (!) recorded classical  chess games
have been decisive. Yes, these two players have drawn each  other 72 times in
long games.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {The Italian - or Giuoco Piano - has
become  increasingly popular lately, in no small part thanks to Kramnik (see
his  masterful domination over Radjabov from the recently concluded Olympiad). 
This is likely the result of players overstudying the Berlin Defense,  where
every variation has been heavily looked into by the top players.  Instead,
elite grandmasters can opt for an opening that is elegant in its  simplicity,
with less concrete preparation and more positional  understanding. All in all,
a perfect choice for players like Kramnik and  Anand, the latter essaying the
opening twice in both the Candidates' and  Sinquefield Cup.} 3... Bc5 4. O-O
(4.c3 {is by far the favorite move in this position, though the game    
transposed to the main variation.}) 4... Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6. h3 d6 7. c3 a6 8. Re1
Ba7 {An important nuance  aided by White's fourth move is that Black was
encouraged to castle early. If instead the Black pawn was on h6 and the king
was uncastled, Black  could very well consider the idea g7-g5 and launch an
attack on the  kingside.} 9. Bb3 {More or less forced, as Na5 threatened to get
rid of  this Italian bishop.} 9... h6 10. Nbd2 Re8 11. Nf1 Be6 12. Bc2 {This is
the second most popular move, and it performs extremely well with an over 60%
score for White.} 12... d5 13. exd5 Bxd5 (13....Nxd5 14.Ng3 {scores
exceptionally well for White.I'd know:     I lost against Bosnian GM Borki
Predojevic in this very line.}) 14. Ng3 Bc5 {I understand the logic behind this
move, to reroute the  bishop to the defensive with Bf8. Yet this allows easy
expansion for  Kramnik on the queenside. On one hand, it is nice for Anand to
not have to worry about Nf5 followed by sacrifices on h6. On the other, it's 
unpleasant to allow a queenside pawn storm more or less for free.} (14....Nd7
{appears to be a very natural move, vacating the f6      square for the
queen.}) (14....Qd7 {Anand likely wanted to avoid this move, considering     
Giri crushed him in the Norway Blitz} 15.Nh4 Rad8 16.Nhf5 Kh8 17.d4 exd4

Bf8 16. a4 g6 {Not a big fan of this move. It stops Nf5, but it  creates a new
vulnerability on f6 and the surrounding dark squares. To be  honest, although
Black's position objectively isn't that bad, I already do not like it. White
has more space, more targets to attack, more plans in  general. Black is in one
of those positions where you must roll with the  punches. Not fun.} ({According
to my database, this position had occurred five times and     in all five
games, the move played was} 16....b5) 17. Bb2 b5 {What else? It permanently
compromises most of the queenside  squares, but Anand hardly could afford to
allow Kramnik to play b5  himself, followed by c4.} 18. Ne4 (18.Bc1 {funnily
enough, might be a strong move.Now that the c5      square can never be
defended via pawn b6, perhaps the bishop is best      placed on e3 where it
also spies on h6.}) 18... Rb8 (18....Nxe4 19.dxe4 Bc4 20.Nd2 Be6 21.Qe2 {is
hugely      problematic.The pawn structure has become symmetrical, but both b5 
    and e5 will be difficult to defend.Meanwhile, White has precisely      zero
weaknesses.}) 19. Bc1 Nd7 (19....Nh5 {feels like it makes more sense.The knight
on d7 has no     future; the knight on h5 might head to f4 if the option
presents      itself.}) (19....Nxe4 20.dxe4 Bc4 21.Nd2 Be6 (21....Bd3 22.Bb3)
22.Qe2 {is similar to the line above.White is much better, since      Black is
devoid of counterplay.}) 20. Bb3 Bxb3 21. Qxb3 Re6 22. axb5 axb5 23. Be3 {Does
Anand control a  single important square on the board? Yeesh.} 23... Nf6 24.
Rad1 {We are taught early on to keep our rooks on open files. So why did
Kramnik choose to place his queenside rook on d1 rather than the rook on e1?
It's likely  that he assessed that his winning chances are optimized by this
move,  goading Anand into capturing on e4 before returning the rook to its home
 on a1.} (24.Red1 {Black is under no obligation to capture on e4; now Black    
 can attempt to trade rooks under his own terms with} 24....Ra8 (24....Nd5
{also makes sense.With the rook scooting off the e1         square, Black need
not worry much about the e5 pawn.})) 24... Nxe4 (24....Nd5 {seems better to
me.}) 25. dxe4 Qe8 (25....Rd6 {fighting for the d-file would make sense if not
for      White easily seizing full control} 26.Bc5 Rxd1 27.Rxd1 Qe8 28.Bxf8
Kxf8 29.Qd5 {Kramnik's pieces control the entire board.The pressure      will
not cease, and it's hard to imagine that Black can keep all of      his
pawns.}) 26. Rd5 Nd8 27. Ra1 Nb7 {The start of a smart maneuever, heading to d6
 where the knight simultaneously protects f7 and attacks the e4 pawn and c4
square.} 28. Ra7 c6 29. Rd1 Nd6 30. Nd2 Ra8 31. Rda1 Rxa7 32. Rxa7 Re7 33. Ra6
{In no universe would it be wise for White to trade here. Look at the strength
of the respective rooks: Kramnik's attacks c6 and controls the  entirety of the
a-file, whereas Anand's is resorting to passive defense,  keeping the seventh
rank protected. There's not much in the way of a  bright future for the black
rook, whereas its counterpart is the reason  the position is superior.} 33...
