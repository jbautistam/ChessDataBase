1. e4 {Notes by Alexander Alekhine.} 1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {This move is
far better than its reputation. Its object is to simplify the position, at any
rate in the variation usually adopted by White, starting 4.exd5, a
simplification which allows Black more easily to evolve a plan of development.
It has been adopted with success at various times by Neimzowitch.} 4. Bd2 {This
idea is interesting but does not produce any advantage if Black makes the
correct reply. The most usual move here is 4.exd5, the consequences of 4.e5 c5
appearing to be rather in Black's favor (compare Dr. Lasker-Maroczy, New York,
1924).} 4... Ne7 {Simplest, for the complications resulting from 4...dxe4 5.Qg4
would give White attacking chances: e.g.: 1) 5...Nf6 6.Qxg7 Rg8 7.Qh6 Qxd4
8.O-O-O, threatening 9.Bg5. 2) 5...Qxd4 6.Nf3 Qf6 7.Qxe4 followed by O-O-O with
good attacking chances for White.} 5. exd5 {White was threatened with: 5...dxe4
and 6...Qxd4.} 5... exd5 6. Qf3 {This is not a normal developing move. As the
sequel will show, most of the White pieces will find themselves on unfavorable
squares. It might have been better to play 6.Bd3 followed by 7.Nge2; 8.O-O-O,
etc.} 6... Nbc6 7. Bb5 {compulsory after the last move.} 7... O-O 8. Nge2 Bf5
{The Black pieces, on the other hand, are well placed for concerted action.} 9.
O-O-O {White's object in playing 6.Qf3 was to castle on the queenside; this is
a strategic error, however, for on the king's side White has no prospect which
might compensate for Black's attack on the queen's side. 9.Rc1, followed by
10.O-O, was certainly not so bad.} 9... a6 {White's b5 bishop must be
eliminated in order to allow a black knight to occupy b5.} 10. Bd3 Bxd3 11.
Qxd3 Na5 {!} 12. a3 {White takes advantage of the opportunity to force the
exchange of one of Black's attacking pieces, for 12...Bd6 fails on account of
13.Nxd5, unmasking the white bishop.} 12... Bxc3 13. Bxc3 Nc4 14. Rde1 Nc6
{Strategically, the game is already won by Black, but the latter here makes a
slight tactical error, which allows his opponent to exchange queens. The simple
plan of attack to lead to an easy win would be: a4 followed by b4-3, etc. The
decision of the game could and should have been brought about by a direct
attack on the king.} 15. Nf4 Qd6 {Against any other move, White's reply 16.Qf3
would have been still more awkward for Black.} 16. Qf3 Rad8 {The plausible Rfd1
would have been wrong, for then 17.Nxd5 and if ...Qxd5; 18.Re8+, etc. However,
White now succeeds in exchanging queens.} 17. Nd3 a5 {Better late than never!}
18. Qf4 {Else Black's attack would become irresistible.} 18... Qxf4+ {If
18...Qd2; White could already try a counter-demonstration with 19.h4 followed
by Rh3.} 19. Nxf4 b5 {This advance remains strong even after the exchange of
queens, for the white bishop is very badly placed.} 20. Nd3 Rb8 21. Ne5 {There
does not appear to be any other method of saving the pawn. But after the
exchange of knights Black finds fresh resources for the attack, with the aid of
his c7-pawn.} 21... N6xe5 22. dxe5 c5 {Less good would have been: 22...b4
23.axb4 axb4 24.Bd4 Ra8 25.b3, etc.} 23. b3 {again the only chance against the
threat of b4, etc.} 23... d4 {The winning move, for this pawn will exert a
decisive pressure in the ensuing rook end-game. Should White avoid the
exhchange of pieces by 24.Bb2, Black obtains a winning advantage by: 24...Nb6
followed by ...a4.} 24. bxc4 dxc3 25. Re3 {Compulsory, for after 25.cxb5 Rxb5
this move would not be feasible because of 26...Rfb8.} 25... b4 26. a4 Rbd8
{For the better appreciation of this end-game, it may be pointed out that White
cannot here offer the exchange of both rooks; e.g.: 27.Rd1 Rxd1+ 28.Kxd1 Rd8+
29.Rd3 Rxd3+ 30.cxd3 g5 31.h3 h5 32.g3 (if f3 then ...h4) g4 followed by Kf8,
Ke7, Ke6 and Kxe5 winning. White's subsequent moves are therefore forced.} 27.
Rhe1 Rd4 28. Re4 Rxe4 29. Rxe4 Rd8 30. e6 {If 30.Re2 Black would win a pawn by
30...Rd4.} 30... fxe6 31. Rxe6 Rd2 {After this incursion by the black rook the

in reality perfectly logical. After Black has clearly shown his intention to
develop the King's Bishop at g7, White has no longer to reckon with any action
on the diagonal e1-a5. There is no reason, therefore, for delay in placing his
Knight on the dominating square d5.} 8... Nxe5 9. O-O Nxf3+ 10. exf3 Bg7 11.

him.} 15. Nc3 d6 16. Be3 Qc7 17. Rc1 Bd7 18. Qd2 Rad8 19. Red1 Bc8 20. Ne4 Nc5
{This will be finally refuted by the combination starting with White's 24th
move--but owing to the weakness mentioned above Black's position was already
very difficult. Unsatisfactory would be, for instance, 20. . . d5  21.cxd5 Rxd5
 22.Nf6+, followed by 23.Bxd5 etc. , winning the exchange; or 20 . . . c5 
21.f5! gxf5  22.Nc3 Nd4  23.Nd5 Qb8  24.Bg5, etc. ; and after the comparatively
safest 20 . . . b6 White could also easily increase his advantage in space by
continuing  21.b4 etc.} 21. Nxd6 Na4 22. c5 Nxb2 23. Re1 b5 24. cxb6 $1 {A
surprising but not very complicated combination. The only difficulty consisted

of the question whether Black can sacrifice a pawn by playing 8...e5; after

9 dxe5 dxe5 10 Nxe5 Nxe5 11 Qxe5 Re8 12 Qb2 (Flohr's move introduced a new move
12...Qd3, which brought his opponent into difficulties. Although White finally
won the game the whole variation still deserves a closer examination.} 8. Bg5
{As the bishop can hardly avoid the exchange a more promising development
appears to be 8 g3 or even 8 b3.} 8... h6 9. Bxf6 {Very harmless. But after 9

always have the move.} 9... Qxf6 10. e3 O-O 11. Be2 e5 {Black has obviously not
the slightest difficulties.} 12. dxe5 dxe5 13. O-O Bg4 {This manoeuver is out
of place as Black's squares d7 and d5 are not sufficiently protected. But also
after the better move 13...Bf5 White would proceed to liquidate on the open
queen's file.} 14. h3 Bh5 15. Rfd1 Rfe8 {Otherwise White's next move would have

probably have played 3 b4 a sacrifice for which White in this particular
position has to my mind sufficient strategical reasons. But playing for the
first time with the Soviet Champion, for whose play I have the greatest
appreciation, I did not like the idea of being accused of overweening
confidence, undue boldness ( and this independent of the result of the game) or
of such things as "underestimating," "bluster", etc.} 3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5.

this interesting move in a game of the talented Slovakian Master, Foltys, from
the recent tournament at Podebrad but did not know that it had already
experimented with in the Moscow Tournament. As the present game shows, the move
permits White to force a quick draw - but no more.} 10... d5 {! Already played

and especially after the next, White can hardly expect anything but an equal
game. Black can easily mobilise his forces, at the same attacking his
opponent's central pawns. The mode of to-day is 4 Qb3.} 4... Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6.

difficulty. Also the tempting ...Nxd4 (which in most variations would leave
Black in a superior position) is not quite satisfactory because of 15 Bxd4 e6
16 Bxg7 Kxg7 17 e5 with a positional advantage for White fully compensating for
the pawn lost. But by the simple 14...e6 15 Bxc6 bxc6 threatening c5 and e5,
Black's advantage would be evident. The establishment of this fact gives to the
present short game a certain theoretical value.} 15. Rab1 e6 16. Bc4 $1 {Now
